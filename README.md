# AssemblyProject

Assembly Program with Cpp developed for Computers Arquitecture Course. 
Compared CPU cycles for two functions doing the exact same thing(Sum of two arrays). When was coded in Cpp and the other in ASM.
It was concluded that the assembly "used" 10 times less CPu cycles since it is considered a low level language ( communicates directly with the machine hardware).
