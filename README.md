# AssemblyProject

Assembly vs C++ performance comparison project for Computer Architecture Course.

## Overview
- Implemented array sum in C++ and Assembly
- Compared CPU cycle usage
- Assembly version used 10x fewer cycles due to low-level optimization

## Technologies
- Assembly language
- C++
- CPU cycle measurement tools

## Results
- ASM: Direct hardware communication
- Lower overhead
- 10x performance improvement
- Demonstrated low-level optimization benefits

## Setup
1. Install compiler toolchain
2. Build both versions
3. Run performance tests
